# Fund Me Hardhat Project on Ethereum Virtual Machine

This project demonstrates a basic crowd funding application on ethereurm blockcian using Hardhat. It comes with  main contract, a couple of test for functions in that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. I have used rinkeby test net for running the application.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help

```
